            Snake Water Gun Game is a simple yet exciting two-player game based on quick thinking and luck, similar to
            Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game involves three elements: Snake, Water, and Gun, each of which has a specific
            interaction with the other. <br>

            Snake drinks Water (Snake wins over Water). <br>
            Water douses the Gun (Water wins over Gun). <br>
            Gun shoots the Snake (Gun wins over Snake). <br>

            Players secretly select one of the three elements and reveal their choices at the same time. The winner is
            determined based on the predefined interactions. If both players choose the same element, the round is a
            tie. <br>

            This fast-paced game is perfect for quick matches with friends, combining fun with an element of strategy as
            players try to anticipate each otherâ€™s choices. <br>
